\arguments{
\item{ae_criterion}{a character vector to specify the AE criterion to filter the interested ones.
For example,
1) ae_criterion = c('AESER != "N"', 'AEREL != "None"')
2) ae_criterion = c('AESER != "N"', 'AEREL != "None"', 'Grade3To5Flag != "Y"', 'AEACN != "DRUG WITHDRAWN"')}

\item{ae_label}{a string vector to specify the according AE labels to be displayed in the selected list.
The default value is c("with serious adverse events", "with drug-related adverse events",
"with toxicity grade 3-5 adverse events","discontinued due to an adverse event")}
